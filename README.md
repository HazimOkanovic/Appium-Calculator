# Appium-Practice

This is one of my projects for practising automation testing with C#, Appium (Android), and NUnit.

The app used for testing is Wish (e-commerce app). There are 17 tests in total, although I plan to continue working on this project so the number of tests will increase. 
They are divided into tests for each functionality. 

All necessary packages are from Nuget and they are:

Appium.WebDriver.4.4.0
Newtonsoft.Json.13.0.1
NUnit.3.13.3.
Selenium.Support.3.141.0
Selenium.WebDriver.3.141.0
DotNetSeleniumExtras.WaitHelpers.3.11.0.
